# 0x06. Responsive design

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

---

### [0. Fix the hero banner](./01-styles.css)
* Because we did some changes with the article.html page in the previous project, our hero banner background is no more visible. Let’s fix it!


### [1. Make the container flexible](./02-styles.css)
* Using the previous file as the base, in your 02-styles.css file update the .container selector by changing width to max-width


### [2. Fix layout issues](./02-1-styles.css)
* Whatever the browser you use, it’s a good idea from now on, to toggle the device view.


### [3. Generate images with responsive breakpoints](./03-index.html)
* Go to Responsive Breakpoints


### [4. Create the mobile icon and hide the menu](./04-index.html)
* We want to have a clickable icon that shows and hide our navigation. We don’t want to use JavaScript but find a pure HTML / CSS way. We learned that input type checkbox have a checked - unchecked state. So we are going to use this for our menu.


### [5. Hamburger!](./05-index.html)
* Let’s now, use a little bit of CSS magic to create an “hamburger” icon just with CSS.


### [6. Add the behavior based on menu-btn state](./06-index.html)
* in your CSS file:


### [7. Make the font size responsive](./07-index.html)
* We have multiple ways to make the typography responsive. The basic way would be to create multiple media queries and set a different font-size. But because we are using REM that are based on 62.5% (defined in the html selector). Changing that value would change proportionally all font sizes.


### [8. Improve the "Works" section](./08-index.html)
* in 08-styles.css, at the end of the /* Card WORK


### [9. Improve the "Footer" section](./09-index.html)
* in 09-styles.css, in the /* Footer section


### [10. Fix the top header background](./10-index.html)
* In 10-index.html, in the body tag, add the class article-page


### [11. Make the article page responsive](./100-article.html)
* use the following article.html for this task
